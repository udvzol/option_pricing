# Option pricing on quantum computers

Quantum Monte Carlo method can be used to achieve a quadratic speedup over the classical Monte Carlo algorithm. 

This repository contains code necessary to price european call options with the quantum Monte Carlo method in Qiskit and to analyze the systematic and statictical errors. For details and usage see the [tutorial notebook](tutorial.ipynb).
